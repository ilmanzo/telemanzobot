# telemanzobot

a simple and educational telegram bot written in Go


## Build and Run

- Edit 'main.go' and put in the value in the variable APITOKEN the token assigned by Telegram for your own Bot (generated by BotFather).
- Install dependencies from a shell:
```
go get gopkg.in/tucnak/telebot.v1
```
- Build with: 'go build'
- Run with:
```
go run main.go
```
or run the generated executable file


## Usage

- Ensure the executable is running
- In Telegram, find the Bot and send them some message

Note that the Bot runs on your PC, so when it's closed it's not available (to you and others Telegram Users).
